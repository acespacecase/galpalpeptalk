# gal pal pep talk

Gal Pal Pep Talk is a side project inspired by my obsessing over lyrics of empowering women like Beyonce, Alanis Morissette, Robyn and Wilson Phillips. Whether through code or quote I hope you find something useful in this.

# What Was Used

Bootstrap
Javascript, jQuery
Slick.js (Carousel)
Google Fonts (Raleway & Arbutus Slab)

# Advice

I am striving to better my code every day, so if you know a better way to code that what you see here, please let me know!
