# gal pal pep talk

Gal Pal Pep Talk is a side project inspired by my obsessing over lyrics of empowering women like Beyonce, Alanis Morissette, Robyn and Wilson Phillips. Whether through code or quote I hope you find something useful in this.

### what was used

Bootstrap

Javascript

Google Fonts (Raleway & Arbutus Slab)

### learning curve

I started this project awhile ago before I really took the time to understand Javascript and jQuery. I struggled with it for a couple weeks, trying excessive libraries and frameworks. Then I gave up. But I thought of the project on a regular basis; I would occasionally need a pep talk from a gal pal and would run through my gal pal pep talk playlist and think of this side project. I picked up FreeCodeCamp's curriculum again and pushed myself to learn Javascript the real way (not the fake way I had tried before). When I didn't understand something, I looked it up or asked a friend for help.

One of FCC's first projects is a Random Quote Generator that functions very similarly to gal pal pep talk. I realized I had my answer on how to code my favorite side project. I was able to finish it within a few hours and here it is!


### advice

I am striving to better my code every day, so if you know a better way to code that what you see here, please let me know!
